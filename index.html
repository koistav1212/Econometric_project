# 1. Project Overview

**Objective:** To empirically analyze the impact of financial inclusion
(specifically microcredit access) on the prevalence of women-led
entrepreneurship across Indian states.

**Context:** This project uses cross-sectional data from 2024 to
understand if increased access to formal financial systems correlates
with higher rates of female entrepreneurship, controlling for other
socio-economic factors.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 2. Hypothesis

**Primary Hypothesis:** \> Access to microcredit (proxied by the
Financial Inclusion Index) has a positive and statistically significant
effect on women-led entrepreneurship in rural India.

-   **Null Hypothesis (**$H_0$): $\beta_{FII} \le 0$ (Financial
    inclusion has no or negative effect on female entrepreneurship).
-   **Alternative Hypothesis (**$H_1$): $\beta_{FII} > 0$ (Financial
    inclusion has a positive effect on female entrepreneurship).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 3. Data and Variables

The analysis uses a cross-sectional dataset of 37 Indian States/UTs for
the year 2024.

### Dependent Variable

-   **FEI (Female Entrepreneurship Index):** A composite index measuring
    the prevalence and success of women-led businesses in a state.

### Independent Variable of Interest

-   **FII (Financial Inclusion Index):** A measure of the extent of
    access to financial services (banking, credit, insurance) in a
    state. This serves as the proxy for microcredit access.

### Control Variables (Features)

To isolate the effect of FII, the model controls for the following
factors:

1.  **Literacy (Female Literacy Rate Percent):**
    -   *Full Form:* Female Literacy Rate (%)
    -   *Rationale:* Education is a key determinant of entrepreneurial
        capability.
2.  **GSDP (GSDP Per Capita Lakh):**
    -   *Full Form:* Gross State Domestic Product Per Capita (in ₹
        Lakhs)
    -   *Rationale:* Proxies the overall economic development and market
        size of the state.
3.  **LFPR (Female LFPR Percent):**
    -   *Full Form:* Female Labor Force Participation Rate (%)
    -   *Rationale:* Indicates the active engagement of women in the
        workforce.
4.  **Urban (Urbanization Rate Percent):**
    -   *Full Form:* Urbanization Rate (%)
    -   *Rationale:* Urban areas typically offer better infrastructure
        and market access.

## 4.2 Data Loading & Preparation

```{r data_loading}
# Load data
# Note: Ensure 'Financial Inclusion.csv' is in the same directory
clrm_model <- read.csv("/Users/koustavsarkar/Downloads/Financial Inclusion.csv", header = TRUE)

# Filtering for 2024 data only (cross-sectional)
df_2024 <- clrm_model %>% filter(Year == 2024)

# Renaming variables for clarity
df_2024 <- df_2024 %>%
  rename(
    FEI = Female_Entrepreneurship_Index,
    FII = Financial_Inclusion_Index,
    Literacy = Female_Literacy_Rate_Percent,
    GSDP = GSDP_Per_Capita_Lakh,
    LFPR = Female_LFPR_Percent,
    Urban = Urbanization_Rate_Percent,
    BankDensity = Bank_Branch_Density_Per_Lakh
  )

# Display first few rows

```

## 4.3 Descriptive Statistics

### Business Problem

> Before estimating how financial inclusion influences women’s
> entrepreneurial outcomes, it is essential to understand the underlying
> distribution of key socio-economic indicators across states.
> Significant variation in literacy, labour force participation, GSDP,
> and urbanization may bias the relationship between FII and FEI if not
> examined upfront. Therefore, descriptive statistics help us assess
> whether states differ widely in development levels, identify outliers,
> and validate that the data is suitable for modeling women’s economic
> empowerment.

```{r descriptive_stats}
# Summary statistics for key variables
summary_vars <- df_2024[, c("FEI", "FII", "Literacy", "GSDP", "LFPR", "Urban")]
summary_stats <- describe(summary_vars)
print(summary_stats)
```

## 4.4 Correlation Analysis

### Business Problem

> We need to check if our key drivers (like Literacy or GSDP) are
> actually related to Female Entrepreneurship before we build a model.
> Also, we need to ensure that our "control" variables aren't just
> measuring the same thing (e.g., if Urbanization and GSDP are 100%
> correlated, we can't separate their effects).

```{r correlation_plot, fig.width=8, fig.height=8}
# Calculate correlation matrix
corr_matrix <- cor(df_2024[, c("FEI", "FII", "Literacy", "GSDP", "LFPR", "Urban")])

# Visualize Correlation Matrix
corrplot(
  corr_matrix,
  method = "circle",
  type = "upper",
  diag = TRUE,
  addCoef.col = "black",
  number.cex = 1.0,
  title = "Correlation Matrix: All Variables (2024)",
  mar = c(0, 0, 1, 0),
  col = COL2('RdBu', 200)
)
```

### Insights

-   **FII and FEI show a very strong positive correlation (0.91):**
    States with higher financial inclusion tend to have significantly
    higher levels of female entrepreneurship, supporting the core
    hypothesis.

-   **Literacy has a moderate negative correlation with FEI (–0.46):**
    Higher literacy does not automatically lead to entrepreneurship,
    suggesting structural or cultural constraints.

-   **GSDP has almost no correlation with FEI (–0.09):** Economic
    prosperity alone does not drive women’s entrepreneurship; financial
    access matters more.

-   **LFPR and Urbanization show weak correlations with FEI (0.40 and
    0.01):** Female labor force participation supports entrepreneurship
    modestly, while urbanization offers no strong direct influence.

## 4.5 Exploratory Scatterplots

### Business Problem

> Before running regression, we must visually check whether the
> relationships between Financial Inclusion (FII), Female
> Entrepreneurship (FEI), and other socio-economic variables are roughly
> linear. Scatterplots help us verify the direction and strength of
> these relationships and reveal whether any states behave unusually
> (outliers) that could distort the model. This visual diagnosis ensures
> that our regression assumptions are valid and that the data is
> suitable for explaining how inclusion, literacy, development, and
> labor participation influence women’s entrepreneurship.

```

### Insights from Scatter Plots with Regression Lines

-   **FEI vs FII:** A clear upward-sloping trend indicates that higher
    Financial Inclusion strongly aligns with higher Female
    Entrepreneurship, supporting the main hypothesis.

-   **FEI vs Literacy:** The downward-sloping line suggests that higher
    literacy does not automatically translate into more
    entrepreneurship—pointing to deeper structural or cultural
    constraints.

-   **FEI vs GSDP:** The near-flat trend shows that state economic
    prosperity has little direct influence on women’s entrepreneurial
    outcomes.

-   **FEI vs LFPR:** A mildly upward slope indicates that states with
    higher female labor force participation tend to have slightly higher
    entrepreneurship levels.

-   **FEI vs Urbanization:** The almost flat line suggests urbanization
    alone does not drive female entrepreneurship; rural SHGs may be
    equally active.

-   **FEI vs Bank Density:** A negative slope implies that more bank
    branches do not guarantee higher entrepreneurship—access quality
    matters more than branch quantity.

-   **Outliers:** Several states diverge notably from trend lines,
    indicating either exceptional performance or underlying constraints
    not captured by these variables.

# 5. Econometric Methodology & Results

**Model:** Classical Linear Regression Model (CLRM) using Ordinary Least
Squares (OLS).

**Equation:**
$$ FEI_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 FII_i + \beta_2 Literacy_i + \beta_3 GSDP_i + \beta_4 LFPR_i + \beta_5 Urban_i + u_i $$

## 5.1 Model Estimation

### Business Problem

> The regression equation models Female Entrepreneurship (FEI) as a
> function of Financial Inclusion (FII) while controlling for major
> socio-economic factors such as Literacy, GSDP, LFPR, and Urbanization.
> We estimate this equation to isolate the *unique* effect of financial
> inclusion on entrepreneurship—separating it from background state
> characteristics that could otherwise distort the results. The purpose
> is to quantify how much FEI changes when FII increases by one unit,
> holding all other factors constant. This gives policymakers a clear,
> numeric measure of the “impact” or “return” of financial inclusion
> programs on women’s economic empowerment. Ultimately, the model tests
> our central hypothesis: **states with higher financial inclusion have
> significantly higher levels of female entrepreneurship, even after
> accounting for education, income, workforce participation, and
> urbanization.**

```

### Econometric Insights

-   **Financial Inclusion (FII)** has a strong, positive, and highly
    significant effect on Female Entrepreneurship (FEI). This means
    states with better banking access, SHG digitization, and credit
    linkage (e.g., E-Shakti) see substantially higher women-led
    enterprise activity.

-   **Female Literacy** shows a small and insignificant negative effect,
    indicating that education alone does not translate into
    entrepreneurship without financial access, mobility, and support
    systems.

-   **GSDP per Capita** is insignificant, suggesting that richer states
    are not necessarily better at enabling women entrepreneurs—financial
    inclusion matters more than state income levels.

-   **Female LFPR** has a significant positive effect, meaning states
    where more women work outside the home provide a stronger foundation
    for entrepreneurship.

-   **Urbanization** is insignificant, showing that women’s
    entrepreneurship in India is primarily **rural–SHG driven**, not
    reliant on urban markets.

-   **R² = 94.47%** indicates the model explains almost all variation in
    FEI, confirming the chosen variables capture the key socio-economic
    drivers relevant to India's SHG and financial inclusion ecosystem.

# 6. Assumption Testing (Diagnostics)

## 6.1 Assumption 1: Linearity

### Business Problem

> Linear regression assumes that each predictor has a **straight-line
> relationship** with Female Entrepreneurship (FEI). This means a 1-unit
> increase in Financial Inclusion (FII) should have the same effect
> regardless of whether a state is highly developed or very poor. If any
> relationship is curved or nonlinear, the model’s predictions will be
> biased. Component–Residual (CR) plots help us visually confirm whether
> our linearity assumption is valid before trusting the regression
> results.

```{r linearity_test}
# Component-plus-Residual plots
crPlots(model_m3)
```

### Insights (CR Plots)

-   **FII Plot:** The pink (actual) line closely follows the blue
    (linear) line, confirming that the relationship between FII and FEI
    is reasonably linear—supporting the use of OLS to measure
    inclusion’s impact.
-   **Literacy & GSDP:** Mild curvature suggests these variables may
    have diminishing effects, but the deviation is not large enough to
    break linearity.
-   **LFPR:** Shows a strong, upward linear trend, meaning linear
    regression captures its effect well.
-   **Urbanization:** Slight hump-shape indicates small nonlinearities,
    but overall pattern remains close to linear.

### Relevance to Our Model

These checks validate that the **OLS regression is appropriate**,
meaning our estimated coefficients (especially for FII) can be trusted.
By confirming linearity, we ensure that the model accurately measures
how financial inclusion influences women’s entrepreneurship—our core
research objective.

## 6.2 Assumption 2: No Perfect Multicollinearity (VIF)

### Business Problem

> In regression, if two predictors (e.g., Literacy and Urbanization) are
> highly correlated, the model cannot clearly identify which variable is
> actually influencing Female Entrepreneurship. This “confusion” makes
> coefficient estimates unstable and weakens the credibility of our
> conclusions about the impact of Financial Inclusion. VIF (Variance
> Inflation Factor) helps us detect and avoid this issue.

```{r vif_test}
# Calculate VIF
vif_results <- vif(model_m3)
print(vif_results)
# Interpretation: VIF < 5 is acceptable; > 10 is serious multicollinearity.
```

### Insights (VIF Results)

-   **All VIF values are below 2**, which is far below the common cutoff
    of 5—indicating that none of the predictors are excessively
    correlated.
-   **No multicollinearity threat:** FII, Literacy, GSDP, LFPR, and
    Urban each provide unique information, meaning the model can
    reliably separate their individual effects.
-   **Interpretation remains trustworthy:** Since multicollinearity is
    low, the strong positive effect of FII on entrepreneurship is not
    artificially inflated or distorted.

### Relevance to Our Model

Low VIF ensures that the regression estimates are **stable,
interpretable, and reliable**, allowing us to confidently claim that
financial inclusion has a distinct and measurable impact on women’s
entrepreneurship in India.

## 6.3 Assumption 3: Zero Mean of Residuals

### Business Problem

> A key OLS requirement is that the model’s prediction errors
> (residuals) must average out to zero. If the residuals have a non-zero
> mean, it means the model is systematically overpredicting or
> underpredicting Female Entrepreneurship across all states—making the
> entire regression biased. Checking this helps confirm that the model
> is properly centered and not producing directional errors.

```{r zero_mean_test}
mean_residuals <- mean(resid(model_m3))
cat(sprintf("Mean of residuals: %.2e (should be ≈ 0)\n", mean_residuals))
```

### Insights (Zero Mean of Residuals)

-   **Mean residual = 1.44e-16**, which is extremely close to zero,
    indicating no systematic overestimation or underestimation.
-   **Assumption satisfied:** This is expected in a correctly specified
    OLS model, confirming that the estimates for FII and other
    predictors are unbiased.
-   **Interpretation remains reliable:** Since the residuals center
    around zero, the model’s predictions for FEI across Indian states
    are balanced and not skewed in any direction.

### Relevance to Our Model

A zero-mean residual confirms that the regression is not structurally
biased, strengthening the credibility of our main finding that
**financial inclusion significantly boosts women’s entrepreneurship** in
the Indian context.

## 6.4 Assumption 4: Homoscedasticity (Constant Variance)

### Business Problem

> For our regression results to be trusted, the **variance of the errors
> must be constant** across all Indian states. If poorer states show
> larger errors and richer states show smaller errors (or vice-versa),
> the model becomes unreliable. This issue—called
> **heteroscedasticity**—can distort standard errors and mislead
> policymakers about the true impact of Financial Inclusion on Female
> Entrepreneurship.

```{r homoscedasticity_test}
# Breusch-Pagan Test
bp_test <- bptest(model_m3)
print(bp_test)

if (bp_test$p.value > 0.05) {
  cat("✓ PASS: Homoscedasticity confirmed (p > 0.05)\n")
} else {
  cat("✗ FAIL: Heteroscedasticity detected (p < 0.05)\n")
}

# White Test (Approximation)
residuals <- resid(model_m3)
white_model <- lm(residuals^2 ~ FII + Literacy + GSDP + LFPR + Urban +
                    I(FII^2) + I(Literacy^2) + I(GSDP^2) + I(LFPR^2) + I(Urban^2),
                  data = df_2024)
white_pval <- 1 - pchisq(nrow(df_2024) * summary(white_model)$r.squared, df = 10)
cat(sprintf("White Test p-value: %.4f\n", white_pval))
```

### Insights (Homoscedasticity Tests)

-   **Breusch–Pagan Test (p = 0.034 \< 0.05):** Indicates
    **heteroscedasticity is present**, meaning error variance is not
    constant across states.
-   **White Test (p = 0.053 \> 0.05):** Slightly suggests **constant
    variance**, but the result is borderline.
-   **Interpretation:** The evidence is mixed, but the Breusch–Pagan
    result signals caution—our standard errors may be unreliable.
-   **Fix:** Use **robust (heteroscedasticity-consistent) standard
    errors**, which is common in Indian state-level economic data where
    variation naturally differs between richer and poorer regions.

### Relevance to Our Model

Detecting heteroscedasticity ensures our policy conclusion—**“higher
financial inclusion significantly boosts women’s
entrepreneurship”**—remains valid even when states differ widely in
income, literacy, and urbanization.

## 6.5 Assumption 5: No Autocorrelation

### Business Problem

> Autocorrelation matters when observations are connected in a natural
> sequence — such as time-series data or geographically neighboring
> states. If one state’s Female Entrepreneurship simply “resembles” the
> next state because they are neighbors rather than because of Financial
> Inclusion, our model would falsely inflate statistical significance.
> We need to ensure that each state provides independent information.

```{r autocorrelation_test}
# Durbin-Watson Test
dw_test <- dwtest(model_m3)
print(dw_test)
# DW statistic should be ≈ 2.
```

### Insights (Durbin–Watson Test)

-   **DW = 1.6056 (close to 2):** No strong evidence of autocorrelation.
    This means each state’s entrepreneurship level is statistically
    independent.
-   **p-value = 0.1046 (\> 0.05):** We fail to reject the null of no
    autocorrelation—supporting model validity.
-   **Interpretation for India:** Despite geographical clustering (e.g.,
    southern states being similar), state-level entrepreneurship does
    not “flow” from one region to another in a way that biases the
    model.

### Relevance to Our Model

This confirms that our estimates—especially the effect of Financial
Inclusion on Female Entrepreneurship—are **not exaggerated due to
spatial dependence**, keeping the regression results trustworthy for
policy decisions.

## 6.6 Assumption 6: Normality of Residuals

### Business Problem

> For our regression results (coefficients, p-values, confidence
> intervals) to be statistically valid, the model’s errors must follow a
> normal distribution.\
> If residuals are highly skewed or heavy-tailed, our inference about
> the impact of Financial Inclusion on Female Entrepreneurship may be
> misleading or unreliable.

```{r normality_test, fig.width=10, fig.height=5}
# Shapiro-Wilk Test
sw_test <- shapiro.test(residuals)
print(sw_test)

par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
# Q-Q Plot
qqnorm(residuals, main = "Q-Q Plot", pch = 21, bg = "steelblue")
qqline(residuals, col = "red", lwd = 2)

# Histogram
hist(residuals, breaks = 8, prob = TRUE, main = "Histogram of Residuals", col = "steelblue")
lines(density(residuals), col = "darkgreen", lwd = 2)
curve(dnorm(x, mean=mean(residuals), sd=sd(residuals)), add=TRUE, col="red", lwd=2, lty=2)
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
```

### Insights (Normality Test)

-   **Shapiro-Wilk p-value = 0.8225 (\> 0.05):** Residuals are normally
    distributed — this supports the validity of our regression model.
-   **Q-Q Plot:** Points lie roughly on the straight red line,
    confirming no major skewness or heavy tails.
-   **Histogram:** Residuals form a bell-shaped curve, reinforcing
    normality.

### Relevance to Our Model

A normal distribution of residuals ensures: - Reliable hypothesis
testing (accurate p-values). - Correct confidence intervals for the
effect of **Financial Inclusion (FII)**. - Trustworthy policy
recommendations for India — showing the model is statistically sound
when evaluating how financial access drives female entrepreneurship
across states.

## 6.7 Assumption 7: No Endogeneity (Influential Observations)

### Business Problem

> Some states may behave *too differently* from the rest — for example,
> a highly developed state like Tamil Nadu or a financially excluded
> state like Bihar.\
> If these states exert an unusually large influence on the regression
> line, they can distort our results and create **false conclusions**
> about the impact of Financial Inclusion on Female Entrepreneurship.

Cook’s Distance helps us detect such influential observations.

```{r influence_test}
# Cook's Distance
cooks_d <- cooks.distance(model_m3)
threshold_cook <- 4 / nrow(df_2024)
influential_indices <- which(cooks_d > threshold_cook)

if (length(influential_indices) > 0) {
  cat("Influential observations detected:\n")
  print(df_2024[influential_indices, c("State_UT", "FEI", "FII")])
} else {
  cat("✓ PASS: No influential outliers detected\n")
}
```

### Insights (Influential Observations)

-   **Detected Influential States:** Assam, Bihar, Delhi, Tamil Nadu —
    these states significantly impact the regression slope.
-   **Why it matters:** These states may have unique socio-economic
    structures (large metros, extremely low/high inclusion) that don’t
    represent typical Indian patterns.
-   **Next Step:** Investigate whether these are:
    -   Data-entry issues,
    -   Structural outliers (e.g., Delhi’s urban bias),
    -   Or valid but unique cases requiring separate policy
        interpretation.

### Relevance to Our Model

Identifying influential observations ensures: - Our estimated effect of
**Financial Inclusion (FII)** is not driven by a few extreme states. -
The regression results reflect **true nationwide patterns**, not
anomalies. - Policymakers receive stable and generalizable insights for
India’s diverse state economy.

This step strengthens the reliability and robustness of our econometric
findings.

Below is a **clean, ready-to-run RMarkdown (RMD)** code template for **Time-Series Analysis** using:

### **1. Scale Normalization**
**Bussiness Problem:** Our variables operate on vastly different magnitudes—the Financial Inclusion Index is a small decimal (0.6–1.0), while MUDRA loans run into lakhs of crores. Plotting them directly would let the massive loan figures completely dwarf the Index, hiding its movements. Scaling standardizes everything to a common 0–1 range, ensuring every variable gets equal visual weight.

```{r}
yearly_data <- clrm_model %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarise(
    FII = mean(Financial_Inclusion_Index, na.rm = TRUE),
    MSME = sum(Women_MSME_Udyam_Thousands, na.rm = TRUE),
    MUDRA = sum(MUDRA_Women_Disbursals_Crore, na.rm = TRUE)
  )


yearly_scaled <- yearly_data %>%
  mutate(
    FII_scaled = scale(FII),
    MSME_scaled = scale(MSME),
    MUDRA_scaled = scale(MUDRA)
  )


head(yearly_scaled)
```
**Key Insight:** This comparison reveals a "multiplier effect": while Financial Inclusion shows steady, linear progress (structural change), Women’s MSME registrations and MUDRA loans show exponential growth—suggesting that policy interventions are actively accelerating entrepreneurship beyond the baseline rate of banking access.


### **2. Time-Series Conversion**
**Bussiness Problem:** A standard data table doesn't inherently understand that "2015 comes before 2016." Converting our data into Time-Series objects (`ts()`) forces R to recognize the temporal sequence. This is the mandatory foundation for any advanced forecasting model (like ARIMA, VAR, or SARIMA) that relies on lags and past momentum to predict future trends.

```{r}
ts_FII   <- ts(yearly_scaled$FII_scaled,   start=2015, frequency=1)
ts_MSME  <- ts(yearly_scaled$MSME_scaled,  start=2015, frequency=1)
ts_MUDRA <- ts(yearly_scaled$MUDRA_scaled, start=2015, frequency=1)
```
**Key Insight:** This transformation validates that our variables are not random but follow a persistent trajectory. It allows us to mathematically confirm that an increase in credit flow (MUDRA) today is a leading indicator for a rise in business registrations (MSME) tomorrow.

### **3. Plot All Time Series Together**
**Business Problem:** Before forecasting, we need to visually inspect how all key variables evolve over time. Plotting the scaled yearly averages helps us detect whether they move together, diverge, or respond to shocks in similar ways. This visual check is crucial for deciding between univariate models (ARIMA) and multivariate models (VAR) that assume co-movement.

```{r}
plot_df <- yearly_scaled %>%
  select(Year, FII_scaled, MSME_scaled, MUDRA_scaled) %>%
  pivot_longer(-Year, names_to="Variable", values_to="Value")

ggplot(plot_df, aes(x=Year, y=Value, color=Variable)) +
  geom_line(size=1.4) +
  geom_point(size=3) +
  scale_color_manual(values=c("steelblue","darkred","darkgreen"),
                     labels=c("Financial Inclusion Index",
                              "Women MSME (Thousands)",
                              "MUDRA Disbursals (Crore)")) +
  labs(title="Clean Yearly Time Series Comparison",
       x="Year", y="Scaled Value", color="Variables") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 16)

```
**Key Insight:** The plot confirms that **Financial Inclusion (FII)** has a stable upward trend, while **Women MSME** and **MUDRA Loans** show steeper, exponential growth. The fact that all three rise together suggests a strong correlation, where improved credit access likely acts as a leading indicator for entrepreneurship growth.
